## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. No Additional Setup Required
The upgrade is ready to use immediately. All files are in place and working.

### Database changes
This upgrade adds two admin-controlled boolean fields to `Product`:

- `is_top_pick` — mark a product to show in the Top Picks section on the home page
- `is_new_arrival_featured` — mark a product to appear in the New Arrivals section

If you are updating an existing installation, run a new migration to add these columns to your database:

```bash
flask db migrate -m "Add product flags for homepage sections"
flask db upgrade
```

If you are working on a development environment without migrations, you can run `FORCE_CREATE_ALL=true python -m scripts.init_db` to create the new columns, but prefer migrations for production.

### 2. Browser Cache Clear
After deployment, users may need to clear cache:
- Chrome: Ctrl+Shift+Delete
- Firefox: Ctrl+Shift+Delete
- Safari: Cmd+Option+E

### 3. Test the Features
- Visit home page to see hero section
- View product cards with hover effects
- Toggle dark mode (button in navbar)
- Check responsiveness on mobile
- Click buttons to see ripple effect

### 4. Customize Colors (Optional)
Edit `static/css/theme.css`:
```css
:root {
  --sg-primary: #10b981;     /* Change this to your color */
  --sg-accent: #f59e0b;      /* Change accent color */
}
```
